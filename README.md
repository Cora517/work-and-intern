This folder records part of my work and internship, including some project codes and an internship video;

The internship mainly includes a research part: exploring how teachers around the world use social media (especially Facebook) and use artificial intelligence (AI) tools in educational environments using Python and R code, and the practical part: internship at AICAMP (an educational institution focused on introducing artificial intelligence to children aged 8-13), including curriculum design, website design, PPT, poster and video production.
